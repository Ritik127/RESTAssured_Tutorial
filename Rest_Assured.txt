 <-----------------------Question---------------------->

	Earlier, we were using dynamic languages such as groovy,
 	ruby to achieve this, and it was challenging.

|Q1| What is Rest Assured? What we can Achieve From RestAssured ? Why We need RestAssured?

Ans  * Java library acts like a headless client to act upon the Rest        web services.
     * validating the HTTP responses from the server.
     * REST APIs using java libraries and integrates well with        Maven. 

|Q2| What are maven Dependency we need?

Ans. maven-dependency = {json-path , xml-path , json-schema-validator ,rest-assured-all ,org.apache.poi , poi-ooxml}
     * for confirmation whether the dependency is downloaded or not
	we can try to import the packages.

|Q3| Syntax of RestAssured?

	*Given() =‘Given’ keyword, lets you set a background, here,you pass the request headers, query 	and path ,param,body,cookies.

	
        * Method() Substitute this with any of the CRUD operations(get/post/put/delete)
	* Then() Your assert and matcher conditions go here
	* When()

|Q4| What is Request Specification?
Ans 	*RequestSpecification is an interface that allows you to specify how the request will look like.
	 This interface has readymade methods to define base URL, base path, headers, etc. 
	 We need to use given() method of RestAssured class to get a reference for RequestSpecification. 
	*To avoid duplicated code and unnecessary test maintenance effort

http://makeseleniumeasy.com/2019/12/10/rest-assured-tutorial-14-interface-requestspecification-how-the-request-will-look-like/#:~:text=RequestSpecification%20is%20an%20interface%20that,get%20a%20reference%20for%20RequestSpecification.

|Q5|
Response response = RequestSpecification Object
			.getStatusCode()
			.getStatusline()
			.getBody() 
			 ResponseBody body = response.getBody();

			headers() [ iterate the loop to get all content]
			header()={Content-type,server,Content-Encoding}
				
// finding is body conatain substring

// To check for sub string presence get the Response body as a String.
	// Do a String.contains
	String bodyAsString = body.asString();

	// convert the body into lower case and then do a comparison to ignore casing.
	Assert.assertEquals(bodyAsString.toLowerCase().contains("hyderabad") /*Expected value*/, true /*Actual Value*/, "Response body contains Hyderabad");
}

//query parameter

Response res = httpRequest.queryParam("ISBN","9781449325862").get("/Book");

//authenticated api

reqres.in

|Q6| How many Information We can fetch from the server by using the     GET Method?

Ans Get [6] ={ Response , getStatusCode(), getStatusLine() , headers() ,getHeader() ,getHeaders() }

|Q7| What Information should be need to Validate or Assert?

Ans Assertion [3] = {Status-code ,Status-line , Response Header,SubString }

|Q8| What we can fetch from Response Header?

Ans header[3] ={Content-type , Server ,Content-Encoding}

|Q9| how many ways in RestAssured to Fetch Response?

Ans * Response.body() : returns ResponseBody
    * Response.getBody() : returns ResponseBody

|Q10| How many way's we can response the Response in another format ?

Ans 

|Q11| Data Type in Rest Assured?

Ans Data_Type[] = { ResponseBody , Response , Headers }

|Q12| Why we should declare RestAssured or import "io.restassured.RestAssured"

Ans  *	It generates HTTP Requests with a base URI.
     *	Provides support to create Requests for different HTTP method types (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, UPDATE, HEAD, and OPTIONS).
     *	It communicates with the server using HTTP and sends the Request created in the tests to the server.
     *	Receives the response from the server.
     *	Provides support for validating the Response received from the server.

|Q13| What is Media-Type Attribute ?

ans 	As we already know the same REST API returns a response message in XML or JSON format.
        This format depends on the Media-Type attribute in the HTTP request.

|Q14| What Does Http Resopnse Packet Contain?

ans HTTP_packet[] ={ A status, Collection of Headers , A Body}

|Q15| what is Content-type Attribute in Header?

ans 	 But then how will the client know what type of response it will get from the API? Well, 
  	 this is managed by the response headers.
	 Response Header contains a Content-Type attribute that informs about the type of response body format.

|Q16| Till now we have read header content & Response code 
	Now We want to read Read Response body, How we will Read Response Body ?
ans 

|Q17| What is Json Evaluator or Path and how we can use ?

ans     *JSONPath is a query language for JSON, similar to XPath for XML.
	*it is use to extract the response of the node
	// First get the JsonPath object instance from the Response interface
	JsonPath jsonPathEvaluator = response.jsonPath();

	// Then simply query the JsonPath object to get a String value of the node
	// specified by JsonPath: City (Note: You should not put $. in the Java code)
	String city = jsonPathEvaluator.get("City");

	// Let us print the city variable to see what we got
	System.out.println("City received from Response " + city);

|Q18| Difference between Authorization & Authentication

ans     Authentication - process for verifying the user 
	Authorization - process for verify whether the user have right to access or not .

|Q19| What is Authorization Header?

ans 	this header can contain the credentials (username and password) in some form.
	 Once a request with Authorization Header is received, 
	the server can validate the credentials and can let you access the private resources.

|Q20| What are different authentication scemes ?

ans  Authentication_Scemes[] = { Preemptive Authentication ,Digest Authentication,Form Authentication ,OAuth Authentication - OAuth1 ,"OAuth2" }

     * The basic authentication scheme requires the consumer to send user id and a password encoded in Base64.[given().auth().basic("user1", "user1Pass")]
	 a server might use a challenge-response mechanism to indicate explicitly when the consumer needs authenticate to access the resource.
	 By default, REST Assured waits for the server to challenge before sending the credentials.

     * [ .auth().preemptive().basic("user1", "user1Pass") ]	
     * Using Digest Authentication - Even though this is also considered a “weak” authentication method,
				     using Digest Authentication represents an advantage over the basic protocol [given().auth().digest("user1", "user1Pass")]
     * Using Form Authentication - Many services provide an HTML form for the user to authenticate by filling in the fields with their credentials.
				When the user submits the form, the browser executes a POST request with the information. [ given().auth().form("user1", "user1Pass")
     * OAuth Support - OAuth is technically an authorization framework, and it doesn't define any mechanism for authenticating a user.
		       Still, it can be used as the basis for building an authentication and identity protocol, as is the case of OpenID Connect.
		       [ given().auth().oauth2(accessToken) ]
     * OAuth 1.0a - In the case of OAuth 1.0a, REST Assured supplies a method that receives
			 a Consumer Key, Secret, Access Token and Token Secret to access a secured resource:
			given().accept(ContentType.JSON).auth().oauth(consumerKey, consumerSecret, accessToken, tokenSecret)
  
  
  

|Q21| What is PUT Method ?

ans  The official HTTP RFC specifies:
	* A PUT method puts or places a file or resource precisely at a specific URI.
	*In case a file or a resource already exists at that URI, the PUT method replaces that file or resource.
	*If there is no file or resource, PUT creates a new one.
	*Responses to the PUT method are non-cacheable.
	*PUT requests usually respond back with status code 200.

	[ httprequest.header("Content-type","application/json").auth().oauth2("#")
	  httprequest.body(qparm.toJSONString());
	  httprequest.put("/public/v2/users/4473"); ]

 |Q22| What is Non-Cacheable ?

 ans    * Dynamic information that changes regularly or for each user request and serves no purpose if it were cached. 
	* Web pages that return the results of a search are non-cacheable, because their contents are unique almost all the time. 

 |Q23| What does cacheable mean in rest?

  ans  Caching refers to storing the server response in the client itself, 
	so that a client need not make 	a server request for the same resource again and again.

 |Q24| What does  idempotent Mean ?
 
  ans 	 an operation is idempotent if it produces the same result when called over and over.
	 An identical request should return an identical result when done twice, two thousand,
	 or two million times
	
 |Q25| Difference Between PUT & POST Method?

 |Q26| POST Method through URL?
 
 ans   https://reqres.in/api/users?email=xyz&firstname=xyz
	[ https://gorest.co.in/ ]
 
 |Q27| PUT Method Through URL
 
  ans  https://reqres.in/api/users/id=868?email=wxy but in RestAssured /868?email=wxy

 |Q28| Status code we can Obtained From PUT & POST method?

 ans POST request

	*201 with a location header pointing to the new resource.
	*400 if the new item is not created.

     PUT request

	*204 for OK/SUCCESS (but no content).
	*200 for OK with Content Body (Updated response).
	*400 if the data sent was invalid.
	*422 Unprocessable Entity
	*429 Too Many Requests
	*406 Not Acceptable

 |Q29| What We Will Validate in After Sending POST & PUT Request?
	
  ans We Will Validate Response code & Response Status.

 |Q30| Step to send a POST & PUT request in RestAssured?

 ans 	*Create JSON data using a simple JSON library.
	*Send JSON content in the body of the request.
	*Validate the response. 
   [	httprequest.body(qparm.toJSONString());
	Response res = httprequest.put("/public/v2/users/4473");
	ResponseBody rbody =res.getBody();
	httprequest.header("Content-type","application/json").auth().oauth2("#");
	httprequest.body(qparm.toJSONString());
	Response res = httprequest.put("/public/v2/users/4473");
	ResponseBody rbody =res.getBody(); ]

  |Q31| How to tell server Authorization key & in which format of data you are sending ?
  
  ans  RestAssured.baseURI = baseUrl;
       RequestSpecification httpRequest = RestAssured.given()
       * .header("Authorization", "Bearer " + token)
        .header("Content-Type", "application/json");
       * [ given().auth().oauth2(accessToken) ]

  |Q32| How to send PUT Method ?
  
   ans Response res = httpRequest.body("{ \"isbn\": \"" + isbn + "\", \"userId\": \"" + userId + "\"}").put("/BookStore/v1/Book/9781449325862");
	& we can also use JSONObject class

  |Q33| HOW to send Delete Request?

   ans //Calling the Delete API with request body
      Response res = httpRequest.body("{ \"isbn\": \"" + isbn + "\", \"userId\": \"" + userId + "\"}").delete("/BookStore/v1/Book");

  |Q34| About Delete Method

   ans 	*The "delete" method deletes a resource from the server. It is quite similar to the rm UNIX 	command.
	*The deletion of a resource is based on the server implementation and the response received is 	non-cacheable.
	*The delete request returns any of the three types of response codes, i.e., 202, 204, and 200.
	*The delete() method used with "path" or "pathParams" deletes the request.
	*To verify the deletion, you may use assertion or any other relevant code as required.

 |Q35| How to validate API Body in RestAssured?
	
 ans   * Assert.assertEquals(bodyAsString.toLowerCase().contains("hyderabad")
       * JsonPath jsonPathEvaluator = response.jsonPath();
	 String city = jsonPathEvaluator.get("City");
